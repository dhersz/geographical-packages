# geographical-packages

The R community has developed, throughout the years, multiple packages that share official geographic, sociodemographic and land use datasets for several different countries. These packages greatly improve the accessibility to this information, which is frequently stored in government-managed archives that do not offer programming APIs to inspect and acquire the data. These packages may remain undiscovered, however, if one is working on a specific region for the first time and is not aware of their existence in the first place.

The main goal of this repo is to list some of the packages that share official data for different countries, improving their discoverability and consequently their usage.
